Description: A CLI tool for generating checksums of media bitstreams
 dano is a wrapper for ffmpeg that checksums the internal file streams of ffmpeg
 compatible media files, and stores them in a format which can be used to verify
 such checksums later.  This is handy, because, should you choose to change
 metadata tags, or change file names, the media checksums should remain the
 same.
